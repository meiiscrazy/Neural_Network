# Neural_Network

## How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
I designed a 3 layer neural network, with 2 hidden layers. I designed one branch to be ReLu with 10 neurons and the other branch to be ReLu with 5 neurons, hoping the model will be performant and reach optimal values.

## Were you able to achieve the target model performance? 
I was not able to acheive the target model performance of 75% and higher. 

## What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
I tried lots of steps to improve model performance like changing the number of nodes per layer and adding more layers. I also tried setting different thresholds for binning with the classification and application type categories. No matter what combination I tried I could not reach the target model performance of 75% or higher. 

## If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
I would use Random forest since Random forest is well suited for decision style parsing which might solve the model accuracy issue I ran into.
